# AegisAI - Empowering Women's Safety Through AI

AegisAI is a Next.js-based project aimed at enhancing personal safety, particularly for women, through AI-powered SOS alerts, geofencing, real-time safety tracking, and wearable technology integration.

## Features

1. **AI-Based Predictive Analytics**: Identifies high-risk areas and times for proactive safety.
2. **Smart Wearables with SOS Alerts**: Discreet wearables that automatically trigger alerts in distress situations.
3. **Anti-Trafficking Smart System**: AI-powered scanning to detect potential trafficking activities.
4. **Voice-Activated Emergency Commands**: Hands-free SOS triggering using voice commands.
5. **Safe Route Recommendations**: AI suggests safer travel routes based on crime data.
6. **Geo-Fencing & AI-Driven Safety Tracker**: Monitors user travel patterns and triggers alerts when outside defined safe zones.
7. **Health-Related Assistance**: Connects users to nearby healthcare facilities or sanitary services in emergencies.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Web app framework for the front end.
- **React Native**: For mobile app development.
- **NodeMCU**: Microcontroller for wearable device integration.
- **Flask API**: Backend for processing SOS alerts and communication.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Machine learning for predictive safety analytics.
- **Google Maps API**: Real-time location tracking and geofencing.
- **Google Speech-to-Text**: Voice recognition for emergency commands.

## Getting Started

##using our own deplaoyed ML-model api for situation and scenario based route prediction by giving it a roadSafety Score.
['https://testmapmlapi.onrender.com/predict_safety']
and other hosted APIs

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
# giftedbooks
